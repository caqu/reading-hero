# ✅ **TASK: tie_leveling_to_word_strip.md**

**Task ID:** `T_TIE_LEVELING_TO_WORD_STRIP`
**Goal:** Connect the Leveling Engine to the Word Strip so that the variants (font, case, syllabification) shown above the tiles match the learner’s current level.

---

## 📝 Task Summary

The app has a “Word Strip” element that shows different printed forms of the current word (e.g. “monkey face”, “MONKEY FACE”, “mon·key·face”, etc.). This must now dynamically adjust based on the learner’s **currentLevel** from the Leveling Engine.

Different levels should reveal increasingly variable and complex printed forms.

## 🎯 Requirements

### **A. Modify WordCard to accept new Level-Based Config**

Add a prop or hook:

```ts
const { level, activeFeatures } = useLevelingEngine();
```

### **B. Word Strip Behavior by Level**

#### **Level 1 — Concept Level**

* Show **only the main word**, in default sans-serif.
* No font variants.
* No case variants.
* No syllables.

#### **Level 2 — Print Variability**

Show:

* lowercase
* UPPERCASE
* Title Case
* serif
* monospace

Do **NOT** show syllables yet.

#### **Level 3 — Orthographic Complexity**

Show everything from Level 2 +:

* hyphenated syllables: `mon-key face`
* dotted syllables: `mon·key·face`
* spaced variant: `m o n k e y`

#### **Level 4 — Motor Independence**

Show:

* all level 3 variants
* but **smaller** and **less prominent**
* keep primary focus on spelling tiles

#### **Level 5 — Generalization**

Show:

* word variants **only briefly** (e.g., 1–2 seconds)
* then fade them to 50% opacity or hide entirely
* allow a toggle for teacher mode to keep them visible

### **C. Implement a WordStrip Component**

File:

```
src/components/WordStrip.tsx
```

It must:

* accept props: `word`, `level`, and `activeFeatures`
* render variants based on level rules
* be styled cleanly, centered under the emoji/video

### **D. Update Styling**

* Word strip should not interfere with typing tiles.
* Use pill-style labels or low-contrast rounded rectangles.
* Ensure it remains responsive.

---

## 🧪 Acceptance Criteria

* Word strip correctly updates as learner level changes.
* All variants appear only in the intended levels.
* Level 5 properly fades or hides variants.
* Word strip integrates smoothly within WordCard.

* Styled pill/label variants
* Integration with Leveling Engine
