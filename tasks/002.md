# ✅ **TASK 2 — create_profile_selector_ui.md**

**Task ID:** `T_CREATE_PROFILE_SELECTOR_UI`
**Goal:** Build a profile selector UI (similar to Netflix) at the top of the left-hand sidebar. Users can click a profile to activate it or create a new one.

---

## 📝 Task Summary

Add a UI component in the left bar:

* Displays the current active profile (emoji + name)
* When clicked → opens the profile selection screen
* Profile selection screen shows a list of profiles
* Option: "Add new profile"
* Option: "Delete profile"
* Selecting a profile sets it as active, updates UI, reloads progress

This should be visually simple and kid-friendly.
